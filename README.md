# which-mario (Super Mario Memory Match)

### Introduction to the Project
This was my second solo project in Mod 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. I started this project on 10/30/19 and finished it on 11/05/19. I was given an example composition with a specific layout and functions/methods/class structures to follow. I used HTML, CSS, and three different JavaScript files. One file was for the bulk of my JS code including majority of the functions/variables and the other two were for classes of Deck and Cards. This was my favorite project of Mod1. I really enjoyed building my first game, and I learned a lot about using CSS animations. I also practiced my localStorage skills and brushed up my abilities to work with classes and objects. The parts of this project that were the most challenging were the CSS animations, finding dynamic ways to instantiate multiple cards, randomizing those cards on the DOM, and manipulating class properties. This was by far the most technical and complex app I have built to date.

### Project Summary
The project is a card matching memory game where one player is first asked to input their name. The next screen greets the player and displays the rules of the game. The following screen sets up the game board with 10 cards face-down. The player must click on a card to reveal it. Once the first card is revealed, the player must click on another card to reveal its face. If the two cards match, they will disappear and the player will see the match counter increase by one. If they do not match, they will flip back over automatically and the player must make another guess. Once all the cards have been matched, the player will see a congratulatory message and their score will be logged on the high score board. The player can then choose to play again to beat their previous score.

### Features Coming Soon!
I was able to store each player’s name and time into the local storage. In the future, I plan to use this information to generate a scoreboard with the top five player’s best scores that will be stored within the user’s browser, even after refreshing the page. I also intend to make the game functional for multiplayer in the future! I hope you enjoy it!
