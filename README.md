# which-mario (Super Mario Memory Match)

### Introduction to the Project
This was my second solo project in Mod 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. I started this project on 10/30/19 and finished it on 11/05/19. I was given an example composition with specific layout and function/method/class structures to follow along with media queries for a tablet and oversized monitor. I used HTML, CSS, and three different JavaScript files. One file was for the bulk of my JS code including majority of the functions/variables and the other two were for classes of Deck and Cards. This was my favorite project of Mod1. I really enjoyed building my first game and learned a lot about using CSS animations. I also practiced my localStorage skills and working with classes and objects. The most challenging part of this project the CSS animations and manipulating class properties in both files.  

### Project Summary
The project was a card matching memory game where one player would first be asked to input their name. The next screen would greet the player and display the rules of the game. The following screen would set up the game board with 10 cards face-down. The player must now click on a card to reveal it. Once the first card is revealed, the player must now click on another card to reveal its face. If the two cards match, they will disappear and the player will see the match counter increase by one. If they do not match, they will flip back over and the player must make another guess. Once all the cards have been matched, the player will see a congratulatory message and their score will be logged on the high score board. The player can then choose to play again to beat their previous score.

### Features Coming Soon!
I was able to store each players name and time into the local storage. In the future, I plan to use this information to generate a scoreboard with the top five players best scores that will be stored within the userâ€™s browser, even after refreshing the page. I also intend to make the game functional for multiplayer in the future!
